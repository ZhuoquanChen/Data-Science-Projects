jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1
jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it.

I have a question about cards in root with persistent effects that you crafted and are now set on the side of your board. Am I able to “spend them” for their suite?

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game.

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0
jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse. 

Thanks for reading. Criticism and questions are encouraged. Disclaimer: I’m on mobile, so the format may look funky.",Throw Throw Burrito is dumb but...,0
jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

Highly recommend it! Another amazing game by David Turczi and Nick Shaw.",Rome and Roll recommendation,0

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

However, the more I play the more I feel that the luck element in terms of how the cards are arranged is considerably more significant than the drafting of cards in 7 Wonders. At times I can look at the tableau, do a little figuring, and realize that in X turns the game is going to end in a military or science victory for one player no matter what the other does.

That takes a little of the shine off of it for me.  It just seems to telegraph too much. I am curious what other people who like the game and have played it a lot more than I have think of this.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

I have a question about cards in root with persistent effects that you crafted and are now set on the side of your board. Am I able to “spend them” for their suite?

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

However, the more I play the more I feel that the luck element in terms of how the cards are arranged is considerably more significant than the drafting of cards in 7 Wonders. At times I can look at the tableau, do a little figuring, and realize that in X turns the game is going to end in a military or science victory for one player no matter what the other does.

That takes a little of the shine off of it for me.  It just seems to telegraph too much. I am curious what other people who like the game and have played it a lot more than I have think of this.

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse. 

Thanks for reading. Criticism and questions are encouraged. Disclaimer: I’m on mobile, so the format may look funky.",Throw Throw Burrito is dumb but...,0

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jcu9kj,grampipon,"I've had Brass Birmingham for around 2 years, and it's my favorite game by far. Several friends of mine, however, heavily disliked it, and seemed to go bankrupt quickly whenever we played. I figured it's hard and it just won't click for some people.

Then yesterday, as I was teaching the game to a new player + going over the rules for two other players who didn't like it before, I found out that loans are 30 pounds, and not 15 pounds like I thought.

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

That being said - now that we played with the correct loan amount, everyone involved liked the game quite a lot.",I just found out I have been playing Brass Birmingham wrong.,0

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with.

The theme is about a post-apocalyptic world caused by an  alien invasion.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0
jcmpr3,EliteLeaf,"Hey people

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

I'm sure the licensing is gone now, so they had to change the art, but everything else seems the same. They did seem to add a wall around the base of the board so you dont lose the marble while playing.

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

jcppl2,Squirrelhenge,"I hadn't played 7 Wonders Duel before it arrived on Board Game Arena recently and I've been enjoying my plays of it since then. However, the more I play the more I feel that the luck element in terms of how the cards are arranged is considerably more significant than the drafting of cards in 7 Wonders. At times I can look at the tableau, do a little figuring, and realize that in X turns the game is going to end in a military or science victory for one player no matter what the other does.

That takes a little of the shine off of it for me.  It just seems to telegraph too much. I am curious what other people who like the game and have played it a lot more than I have think of this.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

My wife and I decided to take on a new quarantine project of writing a board game review blog specifically focusing on the two-player game experience (not necessarily just with exclusively two-player games).  Since we're all being encouraged to keep gatherings small these days, we imagine many, like us find themselves spending extensive time with their significant others, roommates, siblings, etc, so playing games with just two might just be of special interest for many of you, too.

I'd like some help, though.  What are some of your favorite games that have been released in the last year or so that you like to play with just two players?",Best games to play with just 2 players released in '19/20 (not necessarily 2P exclusives),0

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0
jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

I created a scenario-based card game (similar to Exploding Kittens or Cards Against Humanity), and I need help naming it. In short, players hand the dealer a card with a scenario written on it, and the dealers must to choose which scenario he/she would rather do. A scenario might be ""Funnel a fifth of Orloff while wearing assless chaps"" or ""Find Emma Watson on Omegle."" Good scenarios are grouped with goods, bads with bads etc. 

Oh, and ""Would you Rather"" is already taken. :(

Some names I have thought of: Game of Choice, This or That, Cats, Crabs or Missiles (each representing good, bad or neutral scenarios).

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Then yesterday, as I was teaching the game to a new player + going over the rules for two other players who didn't like it before, I found out that loans are 30 pounds, and not 15 pounds like I thought.

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

That being said - now that we played with the correct loan amount, everyone involved liked the game quite a lot.",I just found out I have been playing Brass Birmingham wrong.,0

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

Here's the beginning of a list, with some caveats.  I hope others will suggest additions.  ideally, I'll learn of games I've never heard of!

For my purposes, a game is disqualified if it incorporates cards to any degree, because of the wind.  It also shouldn't have a lot of small parts that can be easily lost outdoors.   A small game footprint also helps, so we don't have to drag a table to the beach.  And bonus points (from me) if it's a good 2-handed game.  

If this post gets a lot of comments, I'll sum up with a Geek list here and on BGG.  Also, if anyone knows of such a list assembled by anyone else, a link would be much appreciated.

2.  Chess (minus points because the wife doesn't like to think that hard on the beach)

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0
7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

jcxcu6,BoboDClown2019,"We recently moved to an area where we'll be spending a lot more time outside, mostly on the beach.  So we're trying to think of which items in our voluminous game collection are best suited to playing outside.

Here's the beginning of a list, with some caveats.  I hope others will suggest additions.  ideally, I'll learn of games I've never heard of!

For my purposes, a game is disqualified if it incorporates cards to any degree, because of the wind.  It also shouldn't have a lot of small parts that can be easily lost outdoors.   A small game footprint also helps, so we don't have to drag a table to the beach.  And bonus points (from me) if it's a good 2-handed game.  

If this post gets a lot of comments, I'll sum up with a Geek list here and on BGG.  Also, if anyone knows of such a list assembled by anyone else, a link would be much appreciated. 

In no particulat order:

1.  Quirkle (table required)

2.  Chess (minus points because the wife doesn't like to think that hard on the beach)

3.  Backgammon

4.  Scrabble

5.  Catan dice (but you've gotta hold on to the score sheets in the wind)

6.  Carcassonne (BIG table required).

7.  [Blank]

8.  Dokmus (table required)

9.  Zombie Dice (but minus points because the game is borderline brain dead)

10.  Sagrada (table required, and minus points for the tiny dice)

11.  Azul (table required)

jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0
7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment.

The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.

I was perusing through the local Target store and came across the the game "" Ghost Castle""

This game immediately reminded me of "" The Real Ghostbusters"" board game from the late 80's. After some research, it looks almost identical. I'm sure the licensing is gone now, so they had to change the art, but everything else seems the same. They did seem to add a wall around the base of the board so you dont lose the marble while playing. I guess that is an improvement, but without the ghostbusters theming it just seems generic and blah.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

You have 60 seconds to discuss with the stranger and put a card facedown on the table. What's your strategy here? Do you agree to Share and hope the stranger is honest? Do you verbally commit to play ""Share"" but actually play ""Take""? Something else?

Would your strategy change if there was only $10 on the table? What about $1,000?

jcxcu6,BoboDClown2019,"We recently moved to an area where we'll be spending a lot more time outside, mostly on the beach.  So we're trying to think of which items in our voluminous game collection are best suited to playing outside.

Here's the beginning of a list, with some caveats.  I hope others will suggest additions.  ideally, I'll learn of games I've never heard of!

For my purposes, a game is disqualified if it incorporates cards to any degree, because of the wind.  It also shouldn't have a lot of small parts that can be easily lost outdoors.   A small game footprint also helps, so we don't have to drag a table to the beach.  And bonus points (from me) if it's a good 2-handed game.  

If this post gets a lot of comments, I'll sum up with a Geek list here and on BGG.  Also, if anyone knows of such a list assembled by anyone else, a link would be much appreciated. 

In no particulat order:

1.  Quirkle (table required)

2.  Chess (minus points because the wife doesn't like to think that hard on the beach)

3.  Backgammon

4.  Scrabble

5.  Catan dice (but you've gotta hold on to the score sheets in the wind)

6.  Carcassonne (BIG table required).

7.  [Blank]

8.  Dokmus (table required)

9.  Zombie Dice (but minus points because the game is borderline brain dead)

10.  Sagrada (table required, and minus points for the tiny dice)

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age).

jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

I have a question about cards in root with persistent effects that you crafted and are now set on the side of your board. Am I able to “spend them” for their suite?

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment.

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

jcu9kj,grampipon,"I've had Brass Birmingham for around 2 years, and it's my favorite game by far. Several friends of mine, however, heavily disliked it, and seemed to go bankrupt quickly whenever we played. I figured it's hard and it just won't click for some people.

Then yesterday, as I was teaching the game to a new player + going over the rules for two other players who didn't like it before, I found out that loans are 30 pounds, and not 15 pounds like I thought.

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.

The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

jcu9kj,grampipon,"I've had Brass Birmingham for around 2 years, and it's my favorite game by far. Several friends of mine, however, heavily disliked it, and seemed to go bankrupt quickly whenever we played. I figured it's hard and it just won't click for some people.

Then yesterday, as I was teaching the game to a new player + going over the rules for two other players who didn't like it before, I found out that loans are 30 pounds, and not 15 pounds like I thought.

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

That being said - now that we played with the correct loan amount, everyone involved liked the game quite a lot.",I just found out I have been playing Brass Birmingham wrong.,0

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

However, the more I play the more I feel that the luck element in terms of how the cards are arranged is considerably more significant than the drafting of cards in 7 Wonders. At times I can look at the tableau, do a little figuring, and realize that in X turns the game is going to end in a military or science victory for one player no matter what the other does.

That takes a little of the shine off of it for me.  It just seems to telegraph too much. I am curious what other people who like the game and have played it a lot more than I have think of this.

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

I'm sure the licensing is gone now, so they had to change the art, but everything else seems the same.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

I created a scenario-based card game (similar to Exploding Kittens or Cards Against Humanity), and I need help naming it. In short, players hand the dealer a card with a scenario written on it, and the dealers must to choose which scenario he/she would rather do. A scenario might be ""Funnel a fifth of Orloff while wearing assless chaps"" or ""Find Emma Watson on Omegle."" Good scenarios are grouped with goods, bads with bads etc. 

Oh, and ""Would you Rather"" is already taken. :(

Some names I have thought of: Game of Choice, This or That, Cats, Crabs or Missiles (each representing good, bad or neutral scenarios).

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

I was perusing through the local Target store and came across the the game "" Ghost Castle""

This game immediately reminded me of "" The Real Ghostbusters"" board game from the late 80's. After some research, it looks almost identical. I'm sure the licensing is gone now, so they had to change the art, but everything else seems the same. They did seem to add a wall around the base of the board so you dont lose the marble while playing. I guess that is an improvement, but without the ghostbusters theming it just seems generic and blah.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group.

jcejjo,whoohaaah1,"Just received this and loving it!

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

jcu9kj,grampipon,"I've had Brass Birmingham for around 2 years, and it's my favorite game by far. Several friends of mine, however, heavily disliked it, and seemed to go bankrupt quickly whenever we played. I figured it's hard and it just won't click for some people.

Then yesterday, as I was teaching the game to a new player + going over the rules for two other players who didn't like it before, I found out that loans are 30 pounds, and not 15 pounds like I thought.

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

Highly recommend it! Another amazing game by David Turczi and Nick Shaw.",Rome and Roll recommendation,0
jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

I have a question about cards in root with persistent effects that you crafted and are now set on the side of your board. Am I able to “spend them” for their suite?

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.

jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.

jcu9kj,grampipon,"I've had Brass Birmingham for around 2 years, and it's my favorite game by far. Several friends of mine, however, heavily disliked it, and seemed to go bankrupt quickly whenever we played. I figured it's hard and it just won't click for some people.

Then yesterday, as I was teaching the game to a new player + going over the rules for two other players who didn't like it before, I found out that loans are 30 pounds, and not 15 pounds like I thought.

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

That being said - now that we played with the correct loan amount, everyone involved liked the game quite a lot.",I just found out I have been playing Brass Birmingham wrong.,0

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

I have a question about cards in root with persistent effects that you crafted and are now set on the side of your board. Am I able to “spend them” for their suite?

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

The theme is about a post-apocalyptic world caused by an  alien invasion.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted.

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted.

My wife and I decided to take on a new quarantine project of writing a board game review blog specifically focusing on the two-player game experience (not necessarily just with exclusively two-player games).  Since we're all being encouraged to keep gatherings small these days, we imagine many, like us find themselves spending extensive time with their significant others, roommates, siblings, etc, so playing games with just two might just be of special interest for many of you, too.

I'd like some help, though.  What are some of your favorite games that have been released in the last year or so that you like to play with just two players?",Best games to play with just 2 players released in '19/20 (not necessarily 2P exclusives),0

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

Here's the beginning of a list, with some caveats.  I hope others will suggest additions.  ideally, I'll learn of games I've never heard of!

For my purposes, a game is disqualified if it incorporates cards to any degree, because of the wind.  It also shouldn't have a lot of small parts that can be easily lost outdoors.   A small game footprint also helps, so we don't have to drag a table to the beach.  And bonus points (from me) if it's a good 2-handed game.  

If this post gets a lot of comments, I'll sum up with a Geek list here and on BGG.  Also, if anyone knows of such a list assembled by anyone else, a link would be much appreciated. 

In no particulat order:

1.  Quirkle (table required)

2.  Chess (minus points because the wife doesn't like to think that hard on the beach)

5.  Catan dice (but you've gotta hold on to the score sheets in the wind)

6.  Carcassonne (BIG table required).

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

Here's the beginning of a list, with some caveats.  I hope others will suggest additions.  ideally, I'll learn of games I've never heard of!

For my purposes, a game is disqualified if it incorporates cards to any degree, because of the wind.  It also shouldn't have a lot of small parts that can be easily lost outdoors.   A small game footprint also helps, so we don't have to drag a table to the beach.  And bonus points (from me) if it's a good 2-handed game.

That takes a little of the shine off of it for me.  It just seems to telegraph too much. I am curious what other people who like the game and have played it a lot more than I have think of this.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0
jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

jcmpr3,EliteLeaf,"Hey people

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

I have played a bunch of games on Tabletop Simulator. Many of these are games I already own a physical copy of. I have also tried out games that I do not own a physical copy of. I don't feel for me that games I have played on Tabletop Simulator should be listed on BoardGameGeek as Owned when I don't actually own a copy of them. I did buy the official copy of The Captain is Dead for Tabletop Simulator. At this point I think I should consider this Owned.

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

I have a question about cards in root with persistent effects that you crafted and are now set on the side of your board. Am I able to “spend them” for their suite?

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

jd5zh0,Bladewing_The_Risen,"Hi guys!

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

I was perusing through the local Target store and came across the the game "" Ghost Castle""

This game immediately reminded me of "" The Real Ghostbusters"" board game from the late 80's. After some research, it looks almost identical. I'm sure the licensing is gone now, so they had to change the art, but everything else seems the same. They did seem to add a wall around the base of the board so you dont lose the marble while playing. I guess that is an improvement, but without the ghostbusters theming it just seems generic and blah.

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

I have a question about cards in root with persistent effects that you crafted and are now set on the side of your board. Am I able to “spend them” for their suite?

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

The theme is about a post-apocalyptic world caused by an  alien invasion.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0
jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there. 
What do YOU think? Tell me how I am wrong and that I am completely missing the point. Or tell me you agree and other reasons why!",Unpopular opinion? I hate board games online...,0

Another thing is their warranty - 14 days for an electronic device?  Seriously?  Haven’t seen how they intend to tie additional publishers in to get more games but they say that new games will be purchasable in the app store.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

I have never played Dark Souls The Board Game, but I am looking for a miniature-based board game that I might use to warm my family (wife and two pre-teens) up to the idea of playing DnD and Warhammer with me—games which they say are “too complicated.”

I’m hoping to give them something similar that is a little more accessible and familiar... so board-based with a clear “story,” but with miniatures and the idea of progression and strategic movements.

Would Dark Souls fit the bill? Is it fun? Is it worth the $100 price tag?

jcmpr3,EliteLeaf,"Hey people

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

Thanks :)",Looking for a solo dungeon crawler with heavy loot,0

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment.

jczeal,zzxiuzz,"Hi guys,

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with. 

I'm still enjoying the game, but I want to adjust my expectations going forward from here. **My question is the title**.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

For exemple, I am playing as the Marquis. I have a persistent effect cards that I have crafted on a previous turn. On this turn, can I remove that card and use it for a bird card to gain an extra turn action on this turn? Or use it for field hospital? 

Or is it that once a persistent effect card is crafted, it stays there for the rest of the game and it’s function is “locked in”.

An add on question would be, how can I remove a persistent effect card from my game if there’s another persistent effect card that I want to craft to replace the first card?

jcihdn,Mr_robit,"Ryan, from Nights Around a Table, introduced me to thinking about a game being 'good', and a game being 'fun' as two distinct characteristics. His example was Concordia, a game he thought of as good, elegant, balanced, deep, straightforward, but he didn't think it was all together fun. Conversely there were some games he found fun that he wouldn't consider good--maybe they are aesthetically pleasing, but poorly balanced. His example for a good blend of both was Everdell with high production value and nice art, but enough strategy and well assembled mechanisms. 

I'm not saying I agree with his every assessment, but the idea of a fun/good Venn diagram interested me. 

What games do you think are fun, but maybe not good? What games are good, but maybe not fun? Do you think his theory is bunk?

I know my wife would say that Keyflower is good, but, much to my chagrin, she doesn't find it fun.

I played Betrayal at House on the Hill with some folks at work and thought it was a lot of fun, but the gameplay itself just didn't feel well balanced, and player elimination was a drag.

For me Inis is a blast to play, but also feels very elegant, balanced, with just enough luck to avoid feeling chess-like, but not so much that it spoils things for the savvy player.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games. 

Other games:

- 7 wonders: seems like a bit similar to Catan

- Dominion","Board games for 3 player, and sometimes 4?",0

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1.

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment.

However, the more I play the more I feel that the luck element in terms of how the cards are arranged is considerably more significant than the drafting of cards in 7 Wonders.

7ayeig,Tylerjsmall09,"Hey guys! I'm new to Reddit, and I joined specifically to ask this question. I created a scenario-based card game (similar to Exploding Kittens or Cards Against Humanity), and I need help naming it. In short, players hand the dealer a card with a scenario written on it, and the dealers must to choose which scenario he/she would rather do. A scenario might be ""Funnel a fifth of Orloff while wearing assless chaps"" or ""Find Emma Watson on Omegle."" Good scenarios are grouped with goods, bads with bads etc. 

Oh, and ""Would you Rather"" is already taken. :(

Some names I have thought of: Game of Choice, This or That, Cats, Crabs or Missiles (each representing good, bad or neutral scenarios).

jcu9kj,grampipon,"I've had Brass Birmingham for around 2 years, and it's my favorite game by far. Several friends of mine, however, heavily disliked it, and seemed to go bankrupt quickly whenever we played. I figured it's hard and it just won't click for some people.

Then yesterday, as I was teaching the game to a new player + going over the rules for two other players who didn't like it before, I found out that loans are 30 pounds, and not 15 pounds like I thought.

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

However, the more I play the more I feel that the luck element in terms of how the cards are arranged is considerably more significant than the drafting of cards in 7 Wonders. At times I can look at the tableau, do a little figuring, and realize that in X turns the game is going to end in a military or science victory for one player no matter what the other does.

That takes a little of the shine off of it for me.  It just seems to telegraph too much. I am curious what other people who like the game and have played it a lot more than I have think of this.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden.

I'm sure the licensing is gone now, so they had to change the art, but everything else seems the same.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game. 

Okay, there are other reasons but this is already turning into a 1000 word essay so I will stop there.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

I would love some opinions on board games for 3 players (frequently) and occasionally 4 or 5 players. I appreciate all reviews.

I know this thread came up in the past, and I have read them all but still couldn't decide yet.

Background: We have 3 players, sometimes 4 or 5 if other friends come over. We have played Catan and we love it. However i think it's a bit luck-based so anything more strategic, deduction will be great. 

Criteria: 
- 20 minutes to 2 hr
- strategy/ deduction
- not so much luck-based
- not too easy so that we dont get bored after 4-5 times

What I am considering right now:

- Carcassonne the big box?!: I played Carcassonne before I enjoyed it but only the base version. Does it work fine with 3 people?

- Ticket to ride: Europe (might buy Nordic also if it goes great with our group). Should I buy expansion 1912 originion US one?

- Clue/Cluedo: good deduction game. I played it before but my housemates haven't. Enjoyed it but it s easy to guess after 3-4 games.

jcljo4,ddlr2,"I had a negative impression of this game whenever I saw it on Kickstarter. It seemed odd to throw objects at others in the middle of a card game. I imagined cards going everywhere, and the frustration that came from picking up the cards you had accumulated. Cue last weekend. My daughter wanted to play it. I bought it because, why not? 

Throw Throw Burrito:

At its core, it’s a card game that consisted of picking cards up and dropping the from right to left, until you can scrounge up three of one type of card. No turns, no waiting, just pick up, drop, continue. You gain points this way. Simple enough. The throwing of squishy burrito-shaped fluffs come from the cards and obtaining three-of-a-kind of certain ones allows you to indiscriminately throw something at a loved one. It’s part of the game, after all. 

Throwing burritos at an 8 year old was actually fantastic. Squeals of joy filled the room as burritos flew by you at random times. Often, you’d anticipate a burrito “brawl” only to be trumped by the word “duel”. That’s correct. You get to have a western style dual with burrito bullets. Although my spouse was reluctant at first, she also joined the games later and it was very exciting. 

The good-

1. No waiting around
2. Throwing stuff is fun
3. The game is simple 

The bad-

1. The game has no strategic methods
2. You really on other player’s discard piles heavily
3. The cards go everywhere when throws are miscalculated

The ugly-

Although the game was fun-filled and scratches the itch for family fun, I cannot say it fulfills the role that some might be hoping for. Luck is the only way to get the cards you need. Hoping you get that next brawl card is an endeavor that everyone playing is aiming for. You want to throw burritos, and can only do so if those adjacent to you are lucky to get the cards. The game length also varies substantially because the number of burrito throwing fun is limited to the negative point tokens. 

The verdict-

I give it a 5/10 under BGG ratings. It was stupid fun. I enjoyed being asked to duel my spouse by my 8 year old. Taking steps, turning around, and launching a burrito with the force of a thousand pitchers. I enjoyed the anticipation of the game. And yet, I did not feel satisfied with the game. It crept along slowly sometimes, and other times ended too abruptly. In the end, the burrito game ended up being ok. It wasn’t bad and I will play this again when I feel the need to launch squishy items at the kids or have a few beers and laughs with my spouse.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age).

jcgwop,Boardofgamesuk,"This may be a very unpopular opinion but I really do not like board games online. I totally understand with the crisis we are facing that board games online or on a computer may be the only way people can play with friends and family and so if that is the situation I understand. In my opinion though I feel that everything I love about board games just does not swap over to a screen. 
Here are some reasons:
I feel isolated from the game - Where are the cards?! Why can't I feel the dice hit the table?! I can't smell the new board game aroma while deciding what to do on my turn. 
You know what I do instead? I drift off, I alt+tab and go on YouTube. I look at my board games sad and alone on the shelf calling out to be opened and played with. There is nothing like having a physical bored game to hold, touch, look at and get completely captivated by the game. On a screen I feel like I'm watching someone else play it. (which I do but it's not the same when it's meant to be me playing. 
It's not anywhere near as sociable - Can you hear me? How about now? Hello?! You disconnected there for a second what did you say?...
It sucks. I miss my boardgame crew and I miss the witty fast back and forth. I miss shouting at them when they ruin something I was just about to do and I miss them abusing me when we add up the scores and I've come in last after all my smugness! ""This is the guy who has a YouTube channel about Bored Games?! Ha!"" They say! How many times is that ruined because someone else is talking at the same time or someone is on their phone because of the previous problem of not being ""into"" the game.

7b1lp9,2ndshot,"Bidding Game

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

Here are the rules, please tell me if there is any flaw or imprecisions. ^ ^",Created a card game in 10 minutes called Karma,1

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

In short, players hand the dealer a card with a scenario written on it, and the dealers must to choose which scenario he/she would rather do. A scenario might be ""Funnel a fifth of Orloff while wearing assless chaps"" or ""Find Emma Watson on Omegle."" Good scenarios are grouped with goods, bads with bads etc.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jcwopv,txbluelacy,"I’ve been intrigued by this game since I stumbled across a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to order it, but it was out of print.  Couldn’t find a copy anywhere but jumped on the KS reprint of 2ed.  Then the pandemic happened, and it’s just been patience patience patience (STILL waiting for my Root Underworld exp to be delivered).  Pax Pamir finally arrived, and I must admit I was intimidated.  The icons and information on the cards, and the instructions...my brain kept making it out to be more complicated.  I set the game up for 3 players, and began tiptoeing through a multi-hand solo game.  Although the area control rules and some of the political rules required reading and researching, the game settled in pretty quickly.  I realized that it is similar to Scythe in that there’s a lot going on, but your turn is actually very simple.  

I was about 2/3rds through my first game when I realized I’d forgotten to shuffle the deck before building the market.  The only regions in play were Transcaspia, Persia, and Punjab.  Although I’d technically figured it the game out at that point, I started over with a shuffled deck this time. Before I knew it, it was 1am, and I’d run through two more games.  The gameplay is so freaking good.  The turns themselves are simple, but there a subtleties and political rules to keep in mind, and I love how a player can spend a bunch of money and cards fighting his way to dominance, get maliciously taken down by the other players, then jump sides at the last minute before a Dominance check and rob the other players of their hard work and take the larger share of the points.

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

If someone can give a good suggestion I will be eternally grateful

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age).

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

Setup

Deal each player 25 tokens and a deck of 52 cards. Split the deck into Red and Black. Play is resolved over two decks. Adjust decks so there is an even number of cards. 

Deck One - The Black Deck

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

jcmuc8,Nuroy," I guess you could label this as a BoardGameGeek philosophy question. Do I list a game that I bought on Tabletop Simulator as Owned on BoardGameGeek?  


I have played a bunch of games on Tabletop Simulator. Many of these are games I already own a physical copy of. I have also tried out games that I do not own a physical copy of. I don't feel for me that games I have played on Tabletop Simulator should be listed on BoardGameGeek as Owned when I don't actually own a copy of them. I did buy the official copy of The Captain is Dead for Tabletop Simulator. At this point I think I should consider this Owned.

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

Deal one card from the Black deck for the number of players to the tableau. Black suites are NOT equal in value. The the face value Ace through King determine the card's value but Spades trump Clubs.  A two of Spades beats a King of Clubs. 

Player bid tokens for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must set ante. Players in turn can raise the bid, pass, or fold. 

When folding a player removes half their bid rounding down, takes the lowest value card, and is out till the next. If a player bid is one token then they must leave one token. If a player bid three then leaves two and takes one. 

Bidding continues until all players have passed. The player with the highest bid removes the highest value card. The player with the second highest bid removes the second highest value card. The pot is discarded but players retain their unused tokens and tokens in their possession should be hidden. 

Deal a new round from the Black Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Deck two - The Bidding on the Red Deck

Deal one card from the Red deck for the number of players to the tableau. Red suites are equal in value with the face value Ace through King determine the card's value. 

Players bid for the cards in the tableau. The winning player from the previous round must lead play. 

Players play from their Black card hands. Once each player has made a play. The players pick from the Red tableau based on their Black card play. Player with the highest value Black card pick first, second highest value card goes second. 

Deal a new round from the Red Deck until the deck is exhausted. 

Scoring

Red cards are scored based on face value. Ace is one point and a King is thirteen points. Each unused token is worth one point. Highest scoring player wins.

For my purposes, a game is disqualified if it incorporates cards to any degree, because of the wind.  It also shouldn't have a lot of small parts that can be easily lost outdoors.   A small game footprint also helps, so we don't have to drag a table to the beach.  And bonus points (from me) if it's a good 2-handed game.  

If this post gets a lot of comments, I'll sum up with a Geek list here and on BGG.  Also, if anyone knows of such a list assembled by anyone else, a link would be much appreciated.

1.  Quirkle (table required)

2.  Chess (minus points because the wife doesn't like to think that hard on the beach)

7auhsy,Le_Codex14,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. I want to show you the card game I created. You will need a full deck of cards, including 1 joker. The numbers of players can go from 4 to 6-7.

- Separate red and black cards and make two decks out of them. Place them separated by a gap the size of 1 card. Get the Aces of hearts and spades. Those are the Clocks. Place them next to their corresponding deck. 

- Draw 1 card for every player. If there is an even number, just pick the same number of red and black cards. If there is an odd number, just add the joker.

- Each player select a card, look at it and put it in front of them face down. This is their team. Red is Life , black is Death, and the Joker is the Peacemaker. Each team's goal is to make their Clock reach 12 (Queen). The Peacemaker's goal is to make the central Karma neutral. 

- After each player got their role, choose at random a red or black card. Place it face up between the two deck. This is the central Karma. If it is red, players draw from the black deck and reverse.

- Each player draw 5 cards, each card from whatever deck they want (you can choose to have 5 red, 4 black and 1 red, 2 red and 3 black, etc..). 

- Each turn, players draw 1 card. Then they play at the same time one card. The player who played the biggest one (Ace has a value of 1) gets to choose one of the played card and add it to their Karma. If it is tied, the players who tied draw a card and battle again. The rest of the cards are put inside the central Karma.

- The way Karma works is like this : if you get a red card and you have no black cards in your Karma, add it to your pile. If you have black cards in your pile, discard one black card with one red card by putting them on the bottom of their deck, until there is none of either of them. Do the same for black cards. Each card count as 1 Karma.

- To modify the Clocks, you must have the corresponding Karma and the next or previous card. Example : to modify the Life Clock (red), which is actually on 6, I need to have at least 1 red Karma and have a red 7 or 5 in hand. If you modify it, draw a card. Each time a Clock's value gets modified, place the old card back into its deck. 

- You can choose to reveal your role before the battle begins. If you do so, if you are red or black, you can either make your Clock go 2 hours forward or the opposite Clock go 1 hour backwards (just search for the corresponding card in the deck and shuffle it afterwards). If you're the Peacemaker, reduce the central Karma to 1 card. After that, reset every player's Karma to neutral (no cards).

- If the central Karma is neutral and there is no Peacemaker, you can draw from whatever deck you want.

jckxql,jsenter,"Even before the pandemic, there was no way for me to find 2 other players able to put in the time for Betrayal Legacy. I still wanted to experience the story, so I played it solo, just now finishing after about a year. I played 3 characters, trying for the heroes to win while playing the traitor to the best of my ability. Here's what I learned:

* The story is, for the most part, fun and well-constructed. The players' choices have a big impact on the history of the house as advertised.
* There are lots of tedious little rules to keep track of, even more than in regular Betrayal. Some mistakes are to be expected.
* The traitor tends to have an advantage in 3 player games, unless the traitor happens to start with lower might than the other characters...
* It is, obviously, less fun solo than multiplayer because the element of surprise is gone. Still, most haunts don't rely too heavily on hidden information, so it's usually possible to play both sides realistically.
* It should also be possible to enjoy the game with 2 players if each player takes 2 characters until the haunt, then the player with the traitor gives away their other character. Some haunts are exceptions to this rule, but the percentage is small enough that the players could either house rule a solution, play with open information, or pick a different haunt.

Overall, I enjoyed experiencing the unique story in spite of the limitations. I easily got my money's worth in hours of entertainment. I would recommend this game to other players in my situation as long as you care less about who wins and more about how the story unfolds.",I played Betrayal Legacy solo...,0

jd04cz,sleepinxonxbed,"Kickstarter Launches October 20th, 2020

I've been playing the **Townsfolk Tussle** demo for the past few days on Tabletop Simulator and I really love it. All three members of the team are graphic designers every piece of the game is beautifully designed, and the flavor text is very rich. The team was inspired by 1930's vintage cartoons like *Steamboat Willie* and *Silly Symphonies* and started development before the game *Cuphead* was even announced, which the art style will definitely draw people to.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group. It's super easy to teach and learn with friends who haven't touched a board game before, but the gameplay loop is fun and addicting and not that heavy of a time/effort commitment. Very excited for this to launch in a few days.",Townsfolk Tussle. A 2-5 player boss battler inspired by KDM with a 1930's vintage cartoon aesthetic. It's REALLY fun!,0

So I bought one deck dungeon and really enjoyed it, still haven't completed it but I really felt that it was missing one thing.

I'm used to arpgs on pc such as diablo, path of exile ect. And I have a few specific things I would absolutely love to find in a board game, heavy emphasis on loot.

I'm looking for a solo dungeon crawler that has something along the lines of a huge stack of cards that are randomized loot when you kill monsters. This is really the only thing I find keeps me going in any game, I'm not fussy on lore, art, luck ect. Although quick set up and price would be a bonus. 

I'm absolutely open to pen and paper and/or game books, just as long as it has heavy randomized loot or something very similar. I've found a couple of board games that meet the criteria but some are asking £80!

jcgtlk,CrittersRules,"(I just finished playing April. Possible spoilers for S1 as well in this thread). 

I knew going into S2 that it was pretty divisive in terms of fan reception, but I decided to pick it up anyway. 

I was pretty psyched after trying out the 'base' version (prologue/January) because I actually enjoyed it more than regular Pandemic. Managing cubes as another type of resource instead of just eliminating them, felt more interesting and strategically appealing. I also really enjoy 'seeding' the board with supplies at the beginning of each game - overall, just more opportunity for interesting decision-making compared to reg Pandemic. 

I've now played through April (a few wins, a few losses) and my enthusiasm is waning. The narrative feels like it hasn't gotten going yet, and new mechanics/plot points/unlockables have been EXTREMELY sparse compared to season 1. I'm 1/3 of the way done, and the game is basically the same - except less satisfying because I have more to accomplish and fewer resources to do it with.

I'm sure the licensing is gone now, so they had to change the art, but everything else seems the same. They did seem to add a wall around the base of the board so you dont lose the marble while playing.

Townsfolk Tussle is not a lengthy campaign, rather it feels like a roguelike, which is really freaking awesome coming off from the recently released Hades from Supergiant Games. You can definitely experience a complete game in one sitting, about 1-3 hours and even multiple times in a game night.

#Setting

The game takes place in **Eureka Springs**, **the Sheriff** just died and colorful **Ruffians** are coming to town to destroy/rob it. The ruffians very from a frog milkman banned for selling poison milk, or a scarecrow that got tired of the town's shit for littering on the ground. You play as *Townsfolk* that come together to defend the town and appoint a new Sheriff for the fourth and final encounter.

#Gameplay

The game is very easy to learn and the gameplay loop is very simple, but really addicting.

* You pick from 6 *""Townsfolk""* that fight against 4 (of 10 possible) *""Ruffians""* randomly chosen, one-by-one. Each Townsfolk has set stats, two passive/active abilities, and their own starting Gear. 

* You draw 3 *""Feats of Medal""* which are the semi-competitive aspect that gives you personal objectives for that encounter to obtain Feat points. The Townsfolk with the most Feats points by the fourth boss battle is declared the Sheriff and gets a special item to deal with a *""Final Fight""* upgraded version of the final Ruffian.

* You draw a *""Town Event""* that includes things like the Townsfolk doing shenanigans like having a spontaneous race out of nowhere, or gambling in the tavern right. Some Town Events are also special cards that get triggered during the Ruffian Encounter, some that deal damage upon a trigger.

* You get to purchase from a shop of ten items randomly drawn from a *very* large stack of gear cards. All the items are wacky, funny, and most actually appear to be useful.

* Ruffians are randomly shuffled in the order of which you encounter them, and have unique traits depending on what part of the encounter tracker they are. The Ruffian variants are (1) Chump (the first encounter), (2) Hooligan, (3) Trouble Maker, and (4) Final Fight. Each Ruffian has their own AI deck of ~15 cards. They also each have specific arenas where you play very large terrain tiles that includes things like a Rickety Farm or a river that bisects the battle map.

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Kingdom Death: Monster (KDM). You have set character sheets with six gear slots. The game is designed around a d10 used to see if you hit based on the accuracy (ACC) of the weapon, but you don't have to roll a second to see if you do damage (which is great!). The numbers are balanced to be very low, most enemy Ruffian attacks tends to deal only 1 DMG, and it makes every action feel significant and I love when games do that.

The game only has 4 of the 10 Ruffian in the TTS build, but each game still feels very unique because of the random order of which you face the Ruffians, especially with their unique Final Fight encounter. Each Townsfolk plays very differently, but even replaying the same Townsfolk can end up with different experiences depending on the random gear that appears in the shop between every Ruffian encounter.

#Comparison to Kingdom Death: Monster

Townsfolk Tussle solves a lot of problems that people face when they want to play a game like Kingdom Death: Monster. It also doesn't replace KDM either, but perfectly supplements it.

* KDM's $400 price tag way too expensive for you? Townsfolk Tussle should be way more affordable. 

* The time commitment of 30 hour-long sessions over several months too heavy? With the potential time wasted if your settlement ends up being destroyed over a few bad dice rolls? Townsfolk Tussle can be finished in one sitting, even multiple times.

* Want to real gateway game to pique your friends interest in KDM? Townsfolk Tussle is perfect for that.

* Frustrated with the lack of communication and radio silence? The developers have been very active and open with the small community of playtesters they have.

#Ending Thoughts

Townsfolk Tussle I can definitely seeing being a game that sees a lot of table time with my friend group.

I don't think I ever felt so bad about a rules misunderstanding in my life. Several of my friends have tried to play repeatedly due to how good I said the game was, only to crash and burn due to a lack of funds. They were also mildly pissed at me for missing such an important rule.

jd9qe7,TurniptheLed,"My wife and I were playing Concordia earlier this evening and came upon two points of contention concerning the architect card.  The rules say, “At the end of his movement, a colonist cannot be placed on a line that is already occupied by another colonist. However, a colonist is allowed to move through occupied lines, adding the occupied sections passed through **into his movement count**.”


1) I took this to mean that if I move through a road that she occupied with her colonist I would place my colonist on the next available road segment.  Since I had three total colonists on the board at the time, this means I would effectively move four road segments but count it as three moves.  My wife understood the card to mean that I would include the road with her colonist in my move count of three, meaning I would effectively move three road segments to match my colonists.  Perhaps a better way to explain this is to say she occupied the road directly outside Roma.  I only wanted to move my colonist out of Roma one road segment, so I skipped her occupied road and places my colonist on the next road, which was actually two away from Roma.  I thought this counted as one but she said that should count as two.


2) Another question was if an occupied road segment were to be my final move (3rd out of 3), then do I place my colonist on the next immediately available road segment or must I stop prior to the occupied road and use the remaining moves with other colonists?",Concordia Architect card movement,0

You have 60 seconds to discuss with the stranger and put a card facedown on the table. What's your strategy here? Do you agree to Share and hope the stranger is honest? Do you verbally commit to play ""Share"" but actually play ""Take""? Something else?

I was perusing through the local Target store and came across the the game "" Ghost Castle""

This game immediately reminded me of "" The Real Ghostbusters"" board game from the late 80's. After some research, it looks almost identical. I'm sure the licensing is gone now, so they had to change the art, but everything else seems the same. They did seem to add a wall around the base of the board so you dont lose the marble while playing.

Disregard and throw away your thoughts on the traditional roll and write, because this isn't one. You'll feel miserable if you play this game thinking it's Railroad Ink or Welcome To. Even a fairly ""heavier"" roll and write like SteamRollers, St. Malo, and Roll Through the Ages are more roll and write than Rome and Roll.

It's a long game that is very thinky. It's more of a full blown board game in a small form factor with a marker. You build a tableau by using resources on dice, which is drafted, to bribe Advisors for their powers and drawing buildings on the Rome main board for their building abilities.

I do agree with Tom Vasel's review of it, that it could have been better suited as a full boardgame with polyhedral pieces for building the buildings on the main board (like in Era: Medieval Age). But this is still a great board game with lots of interesting decision space especially since each player board has different powers and abilities.
