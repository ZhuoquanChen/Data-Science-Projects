# Chest Disease Classification

  This project used deep learning technique in healthcare industry and achieved automaticly detecting and classifying to different types of chest diseases such as healthy, covid-19, bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia by using chest X-ray images, which can help a doctor to determine a chest disease case in short time.
  - Applied Keras' API to build a convolutional networks
  - Applied residual neural network for transfer learning
  - Evaluated resNet training model on test data
  - Applied confusion metric for precision and recall


### Problem Statement

  AI/ML/DL has been revolutionizing in industries of healthcare and medicine, such as medical imagery, drug research and genome development. Also, it has been aproven to be superior in detecting and classifying disease using imagery data. For example, skin cancer could be detected more accurate by deep learning than by dermatologists in 2018.
  - Human dermatologists detection is 86.6%
  - Deep learning detection is 95%
  - Reference: "Computer learns to detect skin cancer more accurate than doctors". The Guardian, 29 May 2018


### Problem Statement

  In this case, I am a deep learning consultant that work at a hospital in New York City. Recently, I have been tasked to develop a model by using extensive chest X-ray images to automate the process of detecting and classifying different types of chest disease, as well as reduce the cost and time of detection. The chest diseases were classified as Healthy, Covid-19, Bacterial Pneumonia and Viral Pneumonia.
