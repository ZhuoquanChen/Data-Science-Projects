### Problem Statement

  Components of a good Problem statement:

  - What data you’re using and how you got it, what question you’re trying to answer, and how you plan to do so:
	- what models you’ll use
	- how you’ll evaluate the success of your model


### Data:

  - What data you’re using
	- How you got the data/where you got it from
	- A little info about the data (rows and columns, data types, data dictionary if applicable)
  
  
### Methodology:

  - Data Cleaning 
    - Handling nulls
    - Getting rid of unwanted characters
    - Making corrections to faulty data
    - etc

### EDA:
- Any interesting findings in your data
- Really good opportunity to add visualizations

### Data Preprocessing
   - Data augmentation (such as encoding categorical variables)
   - Log transforms
   - Scaling
   - Vectorizing
   
   
### Modeling:
  - What features you used
  - What models you used
  - Gridsearching/hyperparameter tuning
  
### Results:
  - Model training & testing scores
  - Any evaluation metrics you used
  - Visualizations here are good
  
### Conclusions:
  - What do these evaluation metrics tell us? 
  - What conclusions can we draw from our model, coefficients, feature importances, etc?
  
### Next Steps:
  - Anything you would like to try if you had more time
